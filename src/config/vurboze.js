Time limits are capped at 90 minutes. vurboze is best used for practice paragraphs, and anything beyond 90 minutes should definitely be handwritten.</p><p>Edits made after the timer ends are still saved, however, upon stopping the session, your piece will become <strong>read-only.</strong> You can stop your session at any time. <strong>Closing the tab will automatically stop your current session.</strong></p><h2>3) Your pieces</h2><p>You can view your previous writing sessions in the sidebar. These are sorted by each text type encountered in <em>VCE English 3/4</em>:</p><ul><li><p>Text Response</p></li><li><p>Creative</p></li><li><p>Argument Analysis</p></li><li><p>Oral (scripting)</p></li></ul><p>As said before, your previous sessions are <strong>read-only,</strong> hence, you must start a new session to continue or edit previous writing.</p><h2>4) Autosave</h2><p>Your pieces are stored on the cloud for every three seconds of inactivity. A save is indicated when the loading symbol (top right) vanishes from the screen. Only signed in users can autosave, and access their previous sessions.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>"
