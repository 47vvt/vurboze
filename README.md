# How to use vurboze

1) What is vurboze?
-------------------

**vurboze** (play on '_verbose_') is your number #1 convenient markdown editor to practice for English sacs!!!

Although practice sacs should ideally be handwritten, its not always possible. vurboze provides a simple, easy, distraction-free interface to keep your study sessions effective.

Use markdown for planning!

1.  **bold**
    
2.  _italics_
    
3.  underline
    

2) Sessions
-----------

Sessions allow you to practice under your specified timed conditions. Time limits are capped at 90 minutes. vurboze is best used for practice paragraphs, and anything beyond 90 minutes should definitely be handwritten.

Edits made after the timer ends are still saved, however, upon stopping the session, your piece will become **read-only.** You can stop your session at any time. **Closing the tab will automatically stop your current session.**

3) Your pieces
--------------

You can view your previous writing sessions in the sidebar. These are sorted by each text type encountered in _VCE English 3/4_:

*   Text Response
    
*   Creative
    
*   Argument Analysis
    
*   Oral (scripting)
    

As said before, your previous sessions are **read-only,** hence, you must start a new session to continue or edit previous writing.

4) Autosave
-----------

Your pieces are stored on the cloud for every three seconds of inactivity. A save is indicated when the loading symbol (top right) vanishes from the screen. Only signed in users can autosave, and access their previous sessions.
